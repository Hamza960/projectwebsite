<p><h1>
THIS SURAH IS ENTITLED AS "THE HEART OF THE QURAN" DUE TO ITS SIGNIFICANT THEME THAT IT UNFOLDS UPON FOLLOWERS. IT WAS REVEALED IN THE LAST DAYS OF PROPHET MUHAMMAD (PBUH) WHEN HE WAS IN MECCA. THE SURAH EXPLAINS THE CONCEPT OF ONENESS OF GOD, HIS MESSAGE AND THE DAY OF RESURRECTION QUITE BEAUTIFULLY. THE VITALITY OF THE REVEREND SURAH CAN BE GAUGED FROM FACTS THAT IT IS AN AILMENT TO CURES, IMPART BLESSINGS UPON THE RECITORS,ALLEVIATE SINS, GRANTS REWARDS OF GIVING CHARITY AND PERFORMING HAJJ.</h1></p>
