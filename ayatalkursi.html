<p><h1>ALLAH! THERE IS NO GOD BUT HE-THE LIVING, THE SELF SUBSISTING, ETERNAL. NO SLUMBER CAN SEIZE HIM NOR SLEEP. HIS ARE ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH. WHO IS THERE CAN INTERCEDE IN HIS PRESENCEEXCEPT AS HE PERMITS? HE KNOWS WHAT APPEARS TO HIS CREATURES AS BEFORE OR AFTER OR BEHIND THEM. NOR SHALL THEY COMPASS AUGHT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE EXCEPT AS HE WILLS. HIS THRONE EXTENDS OVER HEAVENS AND ON EARTH, AND HE FEELS NO FATIGUE IN GUARDING AND PRESERVING THEM, FOR HE IS MOST HIGH, THE SUPREME.</h1><p>
<h1>This is the 255th verse of the second chapter of the Quran.</h1>
